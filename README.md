| Message                                             | Simple class component that demonstrates how to change state with a button click and an event handler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| PersonComponent                                     | Demonstrates how to pass as a props, destruct, and display an object with property values into a functional component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| PersonList                                          | Parent component that contains the array of objects with property values. Elements of the array are passed as props to a child component: PersonComponent. Uses a map function on the array to transform each array element into a child component and adds an explicit key without which a warning would arise.                                                                                                                                    |

| FocusInputParentComponent                           | Parent component that uses a ref to call a method (focusInput) in the child component (Input).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Input                                               | Contains a method will be called by the parent component using the created ref in thr parent and child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| RefsDemo                                            | Refs make it possible to access and manipulate DOM nodes directly in React by assigning the created reference to the ref keyword on the element itself. For example if you have a login form with an input field, and if you want the input field to have focus immediately then you would use Refs. Refs can only be attached to class components.                                                                                                 |
| PortalDemo                                          | Provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. Index.html has a root element with id of root. Using ReactDOM.createPortal you can create a DOM node that is not a descendent of this root element.                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                  
| ErrorBoundary                                       | Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. A class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either or both of the getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hero                                                | Demonstrates error boundaries. Throws an error if props name value like Joker is not a real super hero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Counter                                             | Demonstrates how to make a POST rest call from submitted form data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PureComp                                            | Pure class components are not re-rendered if there is no change in state. Component class must extend the React.PureComponent. If you repeatedly set the state to the same value, the component will NOT be re-rendered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| RegularComp                                         | Non-Pure class components are re-rendered even if no change in state. Component class does NOT extend the React.PureComponent. If you repeatedly set the state to the same value, the component will be re-rendered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| HookCounterWithUseEffect                            | When we use the useEffect hook we are requesting React to execute the function passed as an argument to useEffect on every render.  In order to conditionally execute an effect, you need to pass in a second dependency array parameter of the useEffect hook method.Within this dependency array, we need to specify either props or state that we need to watch for. Only when these array elements were to change, the effect will be executed. |
