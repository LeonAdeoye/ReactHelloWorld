| WithCounter                             | Higher Order Component (HOC) is a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. Allows you to share common functionality (like counters) between components without having to repeat the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ClickCounter                            | The component that passed into the HOC (withCounter) that allows it to be wrapped with additional features and functions. This component increments the HOC counter with mouse clicks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| HoverCounter                            | The component that passed into the HOC (withCounter) that allows it to be wrapped with additional features and functions.

| HookCounterAdvanced                     | Demonstrates the usage of the useState hook method in a functional component. With advanced reset, increment, and decrement features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| HookCounterWithArray                    | Demonstrates the usage of the useState hook method with arrays. Uses the spread operator to copy previous array in the setItems setter (returned by the useState function).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| HookCounterWithObject                   | Demonstrates the usage of the useState hook method with an object. The setter function provided by the useState hook does not automatically merge and update objects. You have to manually merge by yourself using the ES6 spread operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| HookCounterWithUseEffect                | When we use the useEffect hook we are requesting React to execute the function passed as an argument to useEffect on every render.  In order to conditionally execute an effect, you need to pass in a second dependency array parameter of the useEffect hook method.Within this dependency array, we need to specify either props or state that we need to watch for. Only when these array elements were to change, the effect will be executed. |
