| PersonList                              | Parent component that contains the array of objects with property values. Elements of the array are passed as props to a child component: PersonComponent. Uses a map function on the array to transform each array element into child component and adds an explicit key without which a warning would arise.                                                                                                                                      |

| ErrorBoundary                           | Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. A class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either or both of the getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.                                                                                                                                                            |

| PureComp                                | Pure class components are not re-rendered if there is no change in state. Component class must extend the React.PureComponent. If you repeatedly set the state to the same value, the component will NOT be re-rendered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| RegularComp                             | Non-Pure class components are re-rendered even if no change in state. Component class does NOT extend the React.PureComponent. If you repeatedly set the state to the same value, the component will be re-rendered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ParentCompOfPure                        | Parent class component of the pure, regular, and memo component that repeatedly changes state to the same value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| MemoComponent                           | Allows you to create pure functional components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| StyleSheet                              | Integration with style sheets.
